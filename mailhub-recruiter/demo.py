    Subject: Software Engineer Application
    
    Hi there,
    
    I'm writing to apply for the Software Engineer position at your company. 
    I have 3 years of experience in Python and JavaScript, and I've worked 
    on several web applications using React and Django. I'm particularly 
    interested in AI/ML projects and have some experience with TensorFlow.
    
    I have a Computer Science degree from UC Berkeley and have worked at 
    two startups previously. I'm excited about the opportunity to work 
    with your team!
    
    Best regards,
    John Smith
