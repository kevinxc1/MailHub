I submitted my application for the Software Engineer position and wanted to ask a few questions:

1. What does the tech stack look like? I saw you mentioned AI/ML but curious about the specific frameworks.

2. Is this role more focused on backend infrastructure, ML research, or product development?

3. What's the team structure like? Would I be working directly with ML researchers?

4. Do you offer any professional development opportunities or conference attendance?

I'm very excited about the possibility of joining TechCorp and contributing to your mission of democratizing AI.

Thanks for your time!
